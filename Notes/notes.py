1. Introduction to Java
   - Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language.
   - It is platform-independent due to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
   - Widely used for building enterprise applications, web applications, and Android apps.

2. Features of Java
   - Simple
   - Object-Oriented
   - Portable
   - Platform-Independent
   - Secured
   - Robust
   - Multithreaded
   - Architecture Neutral

3. Data Types in Java
   - Primitive Types: int, float, double, boolean, char, byte, short, long
   - Reference Types: Classes, Interfaces, Arrays

4. Operators in Java
   - Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
   - Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
   - Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
   - Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
   - Increment/Decrement Operators: ++, --

5. Control Statements
   - Conditional Statements: if, if-else, nested if, switch
   - Loops: for, while, do-while
   - Break and continue

6. Classes and Objects
   - A class is a blueprint for objects.
   - Objects are instances of a class.
   - Syntax for defining a class:
     class ClassName {
         // fields
         // methods
     }

7. Constructors
   - Special methods used to initialize objects.
   - Same name as the class and no return type.
   - Default constructor and parameterized constructor.

8. Inheritance
   - Allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.
   - Types of Inheritance: Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical.
   - Use the 'extends' keyword.

9. Polymorphism
   - Ability to perform a task in multiple ways.
   - Types:
     1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
     2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

10. Abstraction
    - Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential details.
    - Achieved using Abstract Classes and Interfaces.

11. Encapsulation
    - Wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class).
    - Achieved by making variables private and providing public getter and setter methods.

12. Exception Handling
    - Mechanism to handle runtime errors.
    - Keywords: try, catch, finally, throw, throws.

13. Packages
    - A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces.
    - Use the 'package' keyword.

14. Multithreading
    - Java supports multithreading for running multiple threads simultaneously.
    - 'Thread' class and 'Runnable' interface.

15. File Handling in Java
    - Classes: File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter.
    - Exception Handling in file operations: try, catch, finally.

16. Java Collections Framework
    - Provides data structures for storing and manipulating groups of data.
    - Interfaces: List, Set, Map.
    - Implementations: ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap.

17. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
    - API to connect and execute queries with a database.
    - Steps:
      1. Load the driver class.
      2. Create a connection.
      3. Create a statement.
      4. Execute queries.
      5. Close the connection.
